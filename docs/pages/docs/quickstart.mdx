# Quick Start

Isoflow can be imported as an ES6 module:

```jsx
import Isoflow from "isoflow";
```

### Basic usage

```jsx showLineNumbers
import React from 'react';
import Isoflow from 'isoflow';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Isoflow />
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Note**: this will display a blank Isoflow editor, without icons (which is not very useful!).  To initialise the editor with an iconset, see [Loading Isopacks](/docs/isopacks).

### Dimensions of Isoflow

Isoflow takes _100%_ of `width` and `height` of the containing block so make sure the container in which you render Isoflow in has non-zero dimensions.

### Integration with NextJS

Isoflow cannot be server-side rendered and has to be imported using `next/dyanmic`:

```jsx showLineNumbers filename="IsoflowDynamic.jsx"
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

export const IsoflowDynamic = dynamic(() => {
    return import('isoflow');
  },
  {
    ssr: false
  }
);
```

```jsx showLineNumbers filename="App.jsx"
import { IsoflowDynamic } from './IsoflowDynamic';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <IsoflowDynamic />
  );
}

export default App;
```
